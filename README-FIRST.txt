In this project i will make a website that gives freelancer a platform to sell their service, in this case mostly will be an it freelancer like UI/UX designer or web developer etc. I dont build this project on my own but i just following along a tutorial, it is a premium class in buildwithangga.com (Fullstack website developer - BWAJASA), so this project is only for my own learning process and not to be commercialized. I do this project and upload it into github is just for upgrading my skills so later i can build a similar application and adding more portfolio. This application will use PHP as backend with laravel 8, and it uses tailwind CSS framework in the frontend, also it uses MySql for DBMS.
